Problem in the project:
- Sparcity of the dataset (Item might be not available in the dataset)
    - analysis of frequency of the items
    - clustering of the users in 500 cluster for example?
    - train on all the users?
- Evaluation is on the local model not the global one why?
- Sampling, loading and batching of the dataset
- Add batch normalization and dropout in the model
