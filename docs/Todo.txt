##Problem in the project:
- Sparcity of the dataset (Item might be not available in the dataset)
    - analysis of frequency of the items
    - clustering of the users in 500 cluster for example?
    - train on all the users?
- Evaluation is on the local model not the global one why?
- Sampling, loading and batching of the dataset ==> Sampling bias.
- Add batch normalization and dropout in the model
- use debugger (ML debugger: https://github.com/f-dangel/cockpit and search for others), hyperparameter search model, tracker (https://neptune.ai/blog/the-best-tensorboard-alternatives#comet) or MLflow and the fastest way to store model files
- Choose the federated library: flower, openfl, fate, pysyft
